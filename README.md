# LFU Cache implementation

Greetings from Web Club at NITK! :) We are looking to implement a cache described in the paper titled [An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme](http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf). The aim is to provide the user with a user-friendly, well-documented library for use in their own programs.

## Goal

The project aims to build a library which will provide a cache implementation through an API which provides the following basic functions:

* Import the cache/library module into a program.
* Initialize an empty cache.
* Insert an item into the cache.
* Lookup for an item.
* Remove an existing item from the cache.

## Contributing

We have members with varying experiences in different programming languages! Want to contribute? Amazing :) Please follow guidelines as below:

* If you are implementing the above logic in a programming language X, make sure you name your git branch as `X` and raise a PR for the same. If it already exists, try making it better!
* Benchmark your programs against a test suite. We will be adding the module soon. Comparing different implementations hence becomes easier.
* All code should have atleast 80% code coverage. You can use online tools to check the same. Test cases should be elaborate and should cover corner cases.
* If there are any improvements, raise issues. Try to not ping specific members since some of us might be busy. We will respond soon.
